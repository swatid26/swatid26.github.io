## Healthcare Analysis using Excel

**Project description:** 
Weâ€™ve all had our experiences with healthcare. To improve experiences that occur in the hospital, we need to look back at the data. This particular dataset focuses on types of incoming patients, medications, procedures, length of stay and demographic features. It is a collection of 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care that occurred between 130 hospitals within the United States. 

In this project, I am working to uncover following objectives:

1 - Which department likely needs more lab facilities?

2 - Which department likely needs more rooms to serve admitted patients?

3-  Which age groups need more number of medications?

4-  Do lab procedures mean longer stays in the hospital?

5-  When patients discharge, do they readmit to the hospital in under 30 days?


### 1. Which department likely needs more lab facilities?

Here I wanted to understand which departments perform the most number of lab procedures. Comparing it against the number of patients they get, we can 
decide whether the patients reporting to the department can benefit from establishing more lab facilities.

I used a pivot table and sorted the departments by the number of patients they handeled. Looking at the average number of lab procedures performed, most lab procedures are performed by internal medicine department which also handles the most number of patients. So, the internal medicine department may benefit from setting up more lab 
facilities.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
