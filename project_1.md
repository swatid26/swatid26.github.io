## Healthcare Analytics using Excel and R

**Project description:** 
Weâ€™ve all had our experiences with healthcare. To improve experiences that occur in the hospital, we need to look back at the data. This particular dataset focuses on types of incoming patients, medications, procedures, length of stay and demographic features. It is a collection of 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care that occurred between 130 hospitals within the United States. 

In this project, I am working to uncover following objectives:

1 - Which department likely needs more lab facilities?

2 - Which department likely needs more rooms to serve admitted patients?

3-  Which age groups need more number of medications?

4-  Do lab procedures mean longer stays in the hospital?

5-  When patients discharge, do they readmit to the hospital in under 30 days?


### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
