## Pizza sales analysis using Alteryx

**Project description:** 
Here I am using data from Pizza sales company to analyze the trends in pizza orders received in the year 2015. 
The data has information about types of pizza, their ingredients, prices, quantity ordered, time and date of order. The data is distributed in 4 different tables 
for which I used Alteryx to cleanse, combine and summarize the data.

The objectives for this analysis are below:
1. Which Sizes and category of pizza are most popular?
2. How much sales was gathered by each size category pizza in the year 2015?
3. How the sales were spread across various months of the year 2015? 

The image below shows overall workflow created in Alteryx to achieve the desired results

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
