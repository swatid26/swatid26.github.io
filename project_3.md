**Project description:** 
THE DATA

Weâ€™ve all had our experiences with healthcare. To improve experiences that occur in the hospital, we need to look back at the data. This particular dataset focuses on types of incoming patients, medications, procedures, length of stay and demographic features. It is a collection of 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care that occurred between 130 hospitals within the United States. To take a deeper look at the data, please take a look here.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
